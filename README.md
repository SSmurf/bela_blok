## Development Journey
This app was built as a personal project with two main goals:
	- Make Bela score tracking easier: Traditional pen-and-paper scoring can be cumbersome and error-prone. Bela Blok simplifies this process while adding useful features like declaration tracking and game history.
    - Improve Flutter skills: This project served as a practical way to deepen my knowledge of Flutter development.

## Getting Started
The app is available for both Android and iOS devices.
To run the project locally:
	1.	Ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine
    2.	Clone the repository
    3.	Run ⁠flutter pub get to install dependencies

## Future Plans
    - Three player support
    - Statistics and analytics for long-term play patterns
